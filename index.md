I'm a researcher in machine learning, statistics, and neuroscience. Based in Buenos Aires, currently in Boston.

[CV](https://roccoditella.github.io/cv.pdf)

## Ongoing Projects

- **Multi Modal Galaxies**

  Experiments on Transformer-based Flow Matching to generate multimodal joint distributions.
- **Honest LLMs through introspection**

  Statistically sound measures of LLM confidence with probes.

## Past projects
- **Visual Attention**

  Do Neural Networks implicitly model Human visual attention?
- **Active Learning for more efficient LLM rankings**

  Leveraging statistical active learning to make more efficient LLM comparisons
- **Fast non-parametric Bayesian algorithm for more efficient online experiments**

  A very fast algorithm that enables experiments to optimize their tasks on the fly
