I use tools (Machine Learning and Statistics) for science (Neurscience, Astrophysics).
Currently based in Boston. My current projects are in the context of [AstroAI](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/) and Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

[CV](https://roccoditella.github.io/cv.pdf)

## Ongoing Projects

- **Multi Modal Galaxies** \| [AstroAI](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/), Harvard Center for Astrophysics

  Experiments on Transformer-based Flow Matching to generate multimodal joint distributions.
- **Honest LLMs through introspection** \| [AI Safety Argentina](https://scholarship.aisafety.ar/program/) \& [ICC](https://icc.fcen.uba.ar/)

  Statistically sound measures of LLM confidence with probes.

## Past projects
- **Visual Attention** \| [Kreiman Lab](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu/), Harvard Medical School

  Do Neural Networks implicitly model Human visual attention?
- **Active Learning for more efficient LLM rankings** \| ICC

  Leveraging statistical active learning to make more efficient LLM comparisons
- **Fast non-parametric Bayesian algorithm for more efficient online experiments** \| [Nueroscience Lab, UTDT](https://www.utdt.edu/ver_contenido.php?id_contenido=10518&id_item_menu=20132)

  A very fast algorithm that enables experiments to optimize their tasks on the fly

## Teaching
- Course coming up this August: Machine Learning for Astrophysics \| UBA
- 4 distinct courses on: Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Causal Inference \| UBA
- One very hands on course on Machine Learning (from backprop to generative modelling) \| UdeSA

## Non-academic science writing
